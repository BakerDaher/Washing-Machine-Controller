# Washing-Machine-Controller
A washing machine is a commonly used appliance used to clean clothes. In this  project, we aim to design and implement a washing machine controller using VHDL.  The controller is responsible for controlling the washing machine's cycles such as the washing cycle, rinsing cycle, etc.
